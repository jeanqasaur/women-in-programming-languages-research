# Women in Programming Languages and Software Engineering Research
For your program committees, seminar series, panels, etc.

A couple of comments about women and balance:
* As a result of many well-meaning people trying to balance out committees, women get asked to be on committees *a lot*. It would be good to make it easy for women to say no and, even better, come up with some more globally optimal solution to the fact that while it's important to get women on committees and in front of people so there can be more women eventually, currently there simply aren't enough women to go around.
* Balance should not come at the cost of lower standards. Dropping standards for women (or any other group) introduces **explicit** bias because you're accepting that women can't be held to the same standards. (We talk a lot about implicit bias, but a lot of the bias that exists is often explicit and comes from things like this.) The right thing to do here is to use lists like this one to increase the pool and to be thoughtful about explicit and fair standards. Making it clear that this is what's happening is helpful so that people aren't assuming that the women and minorities got somewhere because of different standards. (Unfortunately, this happens a lot.)

And for people who are wondering why gender-balanced representation is a big deal, Adrienne Porter Felt has a [good post](https://techlady.haus/blog/2017/6/11/peer-review-gender-imbalance-in-program-committees) about this.
